Some children are blessed to have a strong, loving older brother who helps and protects them. You have an all-powerful Big Brother who is constantly looking out for your interests. Even the most committed family member or friend cannot be with you always, but I never leave your side. I am the Friend who sticks closer than a brother. My continual Presence with you should never be taken for granted. Remember that your faithful Friend is also King of kings. If you could glimpse Me in all My Glory, you would understand why John fell at My feet as though dead when he saw Me. I am the First and the Last--the Living One who was dead and is alive forever and ever! I want you to relate to Me with reverence because I am your Savior-God. Remind yourself that the glorious gift of salvation is yours forever-and honor Me with gratitude.",
