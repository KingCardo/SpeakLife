Thank you for dying for my sins and welcoming me into your Kingdom

where I can live with you for eternity!

Psalm 91

 I live under the protection of the Most High, and I find rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
    
    This I declare about the Lord: He alone is my refuge, my place of safety; He is my God, and I trust Him.
    
    For He rescues me from every trap and protects me from deadly disease.
    
    He covers me with His feathers. Under His wings, I find refuge. His faithful promises are my armor and protection.
    
    I am not afraid of the terrors of the night, nor the arrow that flies in the day.
    
    I do not dread the disease that stalks in darkness, nor the disaster that strikes at midday.
    
    Though a thousand fall at my side, though ten thousand are dying around me, these evils will not touch me.
    
    I open my eyes, and I see how the wicked are punished.
    
    I have made the Lord my refuge; the Most High is my shelter.
    
    No evil will conquer me; no plague will come near my home.
    
    For He orders His angels to protect me wherever I go.
    
    They lift me up with their hands, so I won‚Äôt even hurt my foot on a stone.
    
    I will trample upon lions and cobras; I will crush fierce lions and serpents under my feet!
    
    The Lord says, 'I rescue those who love me. I protect those who trust in my name.
    
    When they call on me, I will answer; I will be with them in trouble. I will rescue and honor them.
    
    I will reward them with a long life and give them my salvation.'
